Assignment:
Your assignment is to use your notes from class - along with help from classmates, UTAs, and me - to turn this script into a fleshed-out description of what is going on.

This is a substantial project - we'll work on it in steps over the rest of the unit. 

We are currently focused on the overall process and will cover the details over the rest of this unit.  

Your first assignment is to get this script to run from top to bottom by adding all of the missing R commands.  Once you have done that, you can knit it into an HTML file and upload it to RPubs. (Note - you'll need to add the YAML header!)

Your second assignment, which will be posted later, is to answer all the TODO and other prompts to add information.  You can start on this, but you don't have to do this on your first time through the code.

Delete all the prompts like TODO() as you compete them.  Use RStudio's search function to see if you've missed any - there are a LOT!



Add YAML header!!!
Give it a title


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

### Building an XXXXXXXX (MSA)



TODO: briefly explain what this chunk does, then add the necessary function.

```{r}
# add necessary function
shrooms_align <-      (shrooms_vector_ss,
                     method = "ClustalW")
```


### Viewing an MSA

TODO: briefly summarize what this section will do.


#### Viewing an MSA in R


TODO: Briefly summarize what output is shown below 

```{r}
shrooms_align
```



TODO: briefly explain what is being done in this chunk.  This is tricky (and annoying) so do your best



```{r}
# WHAT IS THE LINE BELOW DOING? (its tricky - do your best)
class(shrooms_align) <- "AAMultipleAlignment"

# WHAT IS THE LINE BELOW DOING? This is simpler
shrooms_align_seqinr <- msaConvert(shrooms_align, type = "seqinr::alignment")
```




TODO: what is the output this produces
```{r, eval = F}
print_msa(alignment = shrooms_align_seqinr, 
          chunksize = 60)
```

#### Displaying an MSA XXXXXXXX



TODO: explain this output and how its differnet from the prevoius

```{r}
## add necessary function
ggmsa::     (shrooms_align,   # shrooms_align, NOT shrooms_align_seqinr
      start = 2000, 
      end = 2100) 
```



#### Saving an MSA as PDF


TODO: explain what this command is doing.
Add the package the function is coming from using :: notation
This may not work for everyone.  If its not working you can comment it out.


```{r, eval = F}
msaPrettyPrint(shrooms_align,             # alignment
               file = "shroom_msa.pdf",   # file name
               y=c(2000, 2100),           # range
               askForOverwrite=FALSE)
```

```{r}
